# Archlinux Installation (AUR)

We have an AUR package. It downloads prebuilt binaries from release page. Run:

```sh
yay -S rustowl-bin
```

If you would like to build from that version instead:

```sh
yay -S rustowl
```

Replace `yay` with your AUR helper of choice.

We also have a git version, that builds from source:

```sh
yay -S rustowl-git
```
